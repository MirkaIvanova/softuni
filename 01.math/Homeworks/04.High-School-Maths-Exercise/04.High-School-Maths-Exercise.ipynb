Test and improve the algorithm\n","5. (Optional) Create a cool demo :), e.g. using Perlin noise to simulate clouds. You can even do an animation (hint: you'll need gradients not only in space but also in time)\n","6. Communicate the results\n","\n","Hint: [This](http://flafla2.github.io/2014/08/09/perlinnoise.html) is a very good resource. It can show you both how to organize your notebook (which is important) and how to implement the algorithm."]},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"m7rq9XY8Rstw"},"id":"m7rq9XY8Rstw","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3 (ipykernel)","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.11.7"},"colab":{"provenance":[],"toc_visible":true,"collapsed_sections":["b6aace82-6631-4087-a5be-962c4dbf6095"]}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
