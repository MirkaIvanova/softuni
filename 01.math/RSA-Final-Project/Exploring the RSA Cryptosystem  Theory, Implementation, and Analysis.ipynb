The efficiency of some factoring methods, such as the elliptic curve method (ECM), relies on the size of the smallest prime factor of n. To maximize security, p and q should be as large as possible within the limits set by n, which influences the speed of encryption and decryption, and thus they should be roughly the same size.\n",
