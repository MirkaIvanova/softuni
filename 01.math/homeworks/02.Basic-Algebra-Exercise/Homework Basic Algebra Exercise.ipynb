You can use the following checklist:\n","\n","* What is the difference between lossless and lossy compression?\n","* When can we get away with lossy compression?\n","* What is entropy?\n","* How are Huffman trees constructed?\n","    * Provide a few examples\n","* How can we get back the uncompressed data from the Huffman tree?\n","* How and where are Huffman trees stored?\n","* Implement the algorithm. Add any other formulas / assumptions / etc. you might need.\n","* Test the algorithm. A good measure would be percentage compression: $$\\frac{\\text{compressed}}{\\text{uncompressed}} * 100\\%$$\n","* How well does Huffman's algorithm perform compared to other compression algorithms (e.g. LZ77)?"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"-JqNofveGpf5"},"source":["# Mirka"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"9ePEsMlnGrsc"},"outputs":[],"source":["import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","import numpy as np\n","\n","# Some example data to display\n","x = np.linspace(0, 2 * np.pi, 400)\n","y = np.sin(x ** 2)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"IcZzbv-0GyHG"},"outputs":[],"source":["# A figure with just one subplot\n","fig, ax = plt.subplots()\n","ax.plot(x, y)\n","ax.set_title('A single plot')"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"0EwDV4tvG5cS"},"outputs":[],"source":["# Stack vertically\n","fig, (ax1, ax2) = plt.subplots(2)\n","fig.suptitle('Vertically stacked subplots')\n","ax1.plot(x, y)\n","ax2.plot(x, -y)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"RI6xJ_YoHUid"},"outputs":[],"source":["# Stack horizontally\n","fig, (ax1, ax2) = plt.subplots(1, 2)\n","fig.suptitle('Horizontally stacked subplots')\n","ax1.plot(x, y)\n","ax2.plot(x, -y)\n","# ax3.plot(x, y)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"RQ1RhgEdIkEr"},"outputs":[],"source":["# Stack horizontally and vertically 2\n","fig, axs = plt.subplots(2, 2)\n","axs[0, 0].plot(x, y)\n","axs[0, 0].set_title(\"main\")\n","\n","axs[0, 1].plot(x + 1, y + 1, 'tab:orange')\n","axs[0, 1].set_title(\"unrelated\")\n","\n","axs[1, 0].plot(x, y**2, 'tab:green')\n","axs[1, 0].set_title(\"shares x with main\")\n","\n","axs[1, 1].plot(x + 2, y + 2, 'tab:red')\n","axs[1, 1].set_title(\"also unrelated\")\n","fig.tight_layout()"]}],"metadata":{"colab":{"collapsed_sections":["6LzT4w3wv5I6","_xTvQ3TIOBGf","np0O0EGCOBGj","BH8mRDS8OBGk","Dqi3H-7-OBGk"],"provenance":[],"toc_visible":true},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3 (ipykernel)","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.12.2"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
